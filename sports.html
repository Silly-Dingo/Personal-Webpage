            <h3>Jack Dempsey</h3>
            <p>The Manassa Mauler, Jack Dempsey competed for 13 years
                    and 7 of them as the reigning heavyweight champion of the world. 
                    Known for his exceptionally aggressive strategy and incredible 
                    punching power, he is regarded as one of the greatest boxers in 
                    the history of the sport.

            <p>Otherwise known as the Cinderella Man, James J. Braddock
                    is perhaps most famous for his incredible comeback 
                    to become heavyweight champion of the world after 
                    living in poverty during the Great Depression. His 
                    determination and drive to provide for his family is 
                    inspirational to many.

            <p>You either love him, or hate him. Conor McGregor
                    is without question a controversial figure in UFC
                    and sport in general. However, aside from his persona 
                    outside the ring, he is an excellent fighter who trains
                    hard and, more often than not, backs up what he says with 
                    action.

                    is widely regarded as one of the greatest in the 
                    history of mixed martial arts. He holds many 
                    records including the most title defences, most wins,
                    longest win streak and most submission victories. He is quite
                    unstoppable.

                <p>Freddie Flintoff is still considered to be 
                    one of the best all-rounders of modern cricket.
                    His fast paced bowling style and aggressive batting 
                    made Flintoff a key player for England after his 
                    test debut in 1998 and saw him become 'Man of 
                    the Series' in the legendary 2005 Ashes Test.

                <p>Shane Warne is in the history books as one of the
                    greatest spin bowlers in cricket. Stacking up over
                    700 wickets during his test career, he is best known 
                    for bowling the 'ball of the century'. If you haven't 
                    seen it, type it in on YouTube. It's considered one of 
                    the greatest wickets in history.

                <p>Despite what you might think, India's national team was 
                    not always that good at cricket. Until the 1970s, they were
                    considered one of the weaker teams in Test cricket. However, since 
                    then, it has produced some of the greatest cricketers in history. With 
                    batsmen like Sachin Tendulker and spinners like Anil Kumble.

                <p>Being the inventors of a game doesn't mean you'll always be the best and
                    England has certainly had difficulty with form, losing almost as much as they
                    win. But over the years, they have produced some spectacular cricketing 
                    performances and continue to churn out consistently excellent cricketers.

                <p>Nicknamed the Caveman, Sebastien Chabal was known for his long
                    hair, big beard and ferocious tackling. During his
                    long career playing at both club and international level,
                    Chabal was utterly feared on the pitch, with
                    opponents often struggling to deal with his aggression.

                    wingers and fullbacks. Playing 51 times for England he 
                    was known for his effective side stepping, his blistering speed and 
                    thus his ability to beat defenders. Because of these skills he racked up 
                    an impressive number of tries.

                    They have a 77% winning record in test-match rugby, the highest
                    for an international team. Furthermore, they have produced some of 
                    the greatest players ever.

                <p>What's not to like about the England Rugby team? Despite losing their first 
                    ever match way back in 1871, England has participated in some of the most 
                    exciting matches in the sport's history. Currently they are the only team from 
                    the Northern Hemisphere to win the Rugby World Cup!
