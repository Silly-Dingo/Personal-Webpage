                <h2>Thailand</h2>
                <p>I travelled to Thailand when I was about 8 years old. 
                But it left such a profound impression on me that I can 
                still remember a great deal about my time there. Not only
                is the weather almost consistently wonderful and the food 
                absolutely amazing, but the colours of the cities and 
                countryside are so vibrant and memorable. The society, 
                rotates around Budhism a great deal, and I was struck by
                the great number of beautiful temples as shown in the 
                picture above. But above all things that Thailand has to 
                offer, the people are far and away the greatest part of 
                the country. There is kindness and generosity in every 
                citizen and you'll be surrounded by smiling faces.
                </p>

                <h2>Italy</h2>
                <p>I have spent several summers in Italy. All over the 
                    country. It has an incredible, rich, history which is 
                    displayed in the hundreds of historic towns and villages 
                    throughout. The countryside is stunning, particularly in 
                    Florence, but equally as impressive are Italy's coastal 
                    towns, built into the rock like in Sorrento. This sunny 
                    part of the country looks out at the dormant volcano 
                    Vesuvius and the ancient city of Pompeii. Without a doubt, 
                    the highlight of my time spent in Italy has been the food.
                    You'll find nowhere else that does Italian food better!

                <p>Some of my earliest memories are of France. And with a father 
                    that speaks French, made for much better holidays!

                <p id="dreams">From the Sahara Desert to the pyramids in Egypt, there
                    are many places I wish to visit in Africa. I might try to discover something new 
                    about the ancient Egyptians!!! The other big reason to travel 
                    there is for the beautiful colours throughout the continent 
                    and the crazy animals!

                <h2>Amazon</h2>
                <p id="dreams">This is a big one. Many, many people have become lost in 
                    the Amazon rainforest. With its vast size, it's no wonder 
                    this happens. If I travel to this mysterious land I'd do a lot of 
                    exploring, and some protecting of its precious ecosystem. There's 
                    so much to do and so much to learn.

                <h2>Svalbard</h2>
                <p id="dreams">I have always been fascinated by the cold, remote, peaceful and the potentially dangerous. Svalbard ticks all 
                    these boxes. Its beautiful natural landscapes are quiet and eerie. Plus who wouldn't want to see the Northern Lights! 
                    However, there are more polar bears than humans!

                <h2>Antarctica</h2>
                <p id="dreams">This, like Everest, has historically conquered people. And its only
                    until relatively recently that humans have been able to survive 
                    its treacherous environment. I think when I travel there, I'll re-trace 
                    the route of the famous doomed expedition of Captain Robert F. Scott over 100 years ago.

                <h2>Everest</h2>
                <p id="dreams">I think my desire to attempt something like this comes 
                    from my uncle. He has always been a very keen trekker, and 
                    when he was younger, he climbed to Base Camp on Everest. I'll
                    start by climbing the three peaks here and then smash this record but it's so expensive and has lots 
                    of tourists too! Perhaps one day I'll try a quieter route.

                <p id="dreams">There's many things the world has to thank America for. Right now, 
                    one of my favourites is the U2 Spy Plane. Capable of travelling up to
                    80,000ft, this impressive plane has been in service since 1956! What's 
                    more, I want to go in one, and travel up that high, see the Earth's curvature from 
                    up there, and the deep blackness of space.

                <h2>Diving</h2>
                <p id="dreams">I want to do things that scare me. Very deep water is one of them. The possibilities of exploration 
                    outweigh that fear now. I think I'll start off with pretty coral reefs
                    in shallow waters, especially as they're dying off now so I'll have to 
                    be quick. Then I'll work my way to dive deeper and deeper so I can swim with whales,
                    maybe find something interesting!

                <h2>Mariana Trench</h2>
                <p id="dreams">Now this, is the definition of scary. Something that is significantly 
                    deeper than the height of a commercial plane's cruising altitude. 
                    No light gets to it, just me drifting down for hours until I reach the bottom. I would love
                    to see what's down there, and hope when I want to return to the surface
                    the weights that keep me at the bottom release!
