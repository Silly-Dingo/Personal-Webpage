            <p>I think my life would not be worth it, if there wasn't 
                    any music. I have changing tastes, but there are constants. 
                    Classial music is really my background. 
                    My grandpa founded and conducted an orchestra so 
                    I spent many difficult but happy hours attending his concerts 
                    from a very very early age. But in contrast, I love to rock! All 
                    its varieties have been a huge
                    part of my life. More recently I have got into 
                    alternative music which tends to be more emotionally engaging. 
                    All music that is profound to me, I assign to represent milestones.
                    It's a good way to keep track of the mayhem that occurs in one's life. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="con1">
            <p>I have always been very musical. I started at the age of three playing 
                the violin, which didn't last very long. Then the typical primary school child playing
                    the recorder! For about 4 or 5 years I played the cello, which was 
                    great, but the practicing was a chore. But my favourites will always be the guitar and singing. 
                    Since 5, I have played the guitar, and singing has always gone well with it.
                    They are my solid go to for whatever mood I am in and wherever I am I sing to myself. Each guitar I have 
                    played has meant a lot to me. They make for pretty loyal and understanding 
                    companions! 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="con1">
            <p>In the past I have been in a couple of bands. Sometimes I was frontman, in others I was just a rhythm guitarist
                But none of them really worked out. I put it down to
                creative differences. It has been quite a few years since I have been in a band and I would very much
                    like to get back in to one. I will see if I can set up a band or, failing that, join one. 
                    Even if that doesn't work out i'll continue to play. What would be useful in the near future is to 
                    put in some more hours dedicated to practicing and improving my guitar skills. Then I might even be able to be
                    the lead guitarist! Ooh I might also learn the piano too.

                <h3>Brian Jonestown Massacre</h3>
                <p id="bjmPara">They are, quite frankly, an extremely underrated and underappreciated 
                    band. Predominantly known as a psychedelic rock band, they are credited
                    with reviving the sound of original 60's rock and pop and blending it
                    for the modern times.

                <h3>Red Hot Chili Peppers</h3>
                <p id="redPara">Initially a formidable funk group starting way back in 1983, over the years 
                    the Red Hot Chili Peppers have morphed into one of the most popular rock 
                    bands in the world. What's more, they continue to release excellent music
                    which is a rare thing indeed with an aging band.

                <h3>Nirvana</h3>
                <p id="nirvPara">A legendary and tragic story, Nirvana's life was epic and wild but 
                    far, far too short. In the space of 7 years, the band released three albums, 
                    all of which are highly rated and continue to sell to this day.

                <h3>Radiohead</h3>
                <p id="radPara">One of the most versatile bands of the modern era. What is also impressive,
                    are the consistently high quality albums they have released over their long
                    career and also that they have never once changed their line-up.</p>

                <p id="hendPara">Regarded by most as the greatest rock guitarist to ever live, Jimi Hendrix is 
                    known for three things: Being left handed, dying at 27 and absolutely shredding
                    on the guitar.

                <p id="pagePara">With his iconic double necked guitar pictured above, Jimmy Page rocked with 
                    many great bands. He's most famous for being the guitarist for the Yardbirds
                    and then becoming the legendary guitarist for Led Zeppelin.

                    are credited with giving Pink Floyd their notable soft, pure and crazy sound.

                <h3>Keith Richards</h3>
                <p id="richPara">Many believe this man will never die, and i'm inclined to believe them. Like all the greats,
                    Richards is a self-taught guitarist and the lead for the Rolling Stones. His long career 
                    is legendary and spectacular, even the ugly bits!
